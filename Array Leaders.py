'''
You are given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.

Examples:

Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: [17, 5, 2]
Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.
Input: arr = [10, 4, 2, 4, 1]
Output: [10, 4, 4, 1]
Explanation: Note that both of the 4s are in output, as to be a leader an equal element is also allowed on the right. side
Input: arr = [5, 10, 20, 40]
Output: [40]
Explanation: When an array is sorted in increasing order, only the rightmost element is leader.
Input: arr = [30, 10, 10, 5]
Output: [30, 10, 10, 5]
Explanation: When an array is sorted in non-increasing order, all elements are leaders.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 106
0 <= arr[i] <= 106
