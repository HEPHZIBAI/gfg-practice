'''
Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a  pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

Help Geek to build a pattern.

 

Example 1:

Input: 5

Output:
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 
1 2  
1 

 

Your Task:

You don't need to input anything. Complete the function printTriangle() which takes  an integer n  as the input parameter and print the pattern.

Constraints:

1<= N <= 20
Python3

'''


class Solution:
    def printTriangle(self, N):
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(1,N-i+1):
                print(j,end=" ")
            print()
