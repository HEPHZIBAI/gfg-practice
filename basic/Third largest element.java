/*
Given an array, arr of positive integers. Find the third largest element in it. Return -1 if the third largest element is not found.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The third largest element in the array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] is 3.
Input: arr[] = [10, 2]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are less than three elements in the array, so the third largest element cannot be determined.
Input: arr[] = [5, 5, 5]
Output: 5
Explanation: In the array [5, 5, 5], the third largest element can be considered 5, as there are no other distinct elements.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ arr.size â‰¤ 105
1 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤ 105
