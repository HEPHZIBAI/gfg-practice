'''
Given the time represented by two integers h (hour) and m (minute), calculate the angle between the hour hand and the minute hand on a standard 12-hour clock.

Note: There can be two angles between hands; we need to print a minimum of two. Also, we need to print the floor of the final result angle. For example, if the final angle is 10.61, we need to print 10.

Examples:

Input: h = 9 , m = 0
Output: 90
Explanation: The minimum angle between hour and minute hand when the time is 9 is 90 degress.
Input: h = 3 , m = 30
Output: 75
Explanation: The minimum angle between hour and minute hand when the time is 3:30 is 75 degress.
Constraints:
1 ≤ h ≤ 12
0 ≤ m < 60
h and m are Integers
