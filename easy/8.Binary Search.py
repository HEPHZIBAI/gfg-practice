'''
Given a sorted array arr and an integer k, find the position(0-based indexing) at which k is present in the array using binary search.

Note: If multiple occurrences are there, please return the smallest index.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 4 appears at index 3.
Input: arr[] = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55], k = 445
Output: -1
Explanation: 445 is not present.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: 1 appears at index 0.
Note: Try to solve this problem in constant space i.e O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 106
1 <= k <= 106

'''

class Solution:
    def binarysearch(self, arr, k):
        if k not in arr:
            return -1
        return arr.index(k)
